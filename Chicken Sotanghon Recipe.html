    <!-- Finally, the steps on how to cook the dish -->
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h5>Step 1</h5>
    <p>Bring water and 1 teaspoon salt to a boil in a large pot. Add chicken legs and simmer until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Reserving the liquid, remove chicken and allow to cool, then remove meat from the bones and shred with two forks. Discard the skin and bones.</p>
    <h5>Step 2</h5>
    <p>Meanwhile, place shiitake mushrooms in a bowl and pour enough warm water over them to cover completely; allow to soak until pliable, about 30 minutes. Remove mushrooms, reserving water; slice, and set aside. Place noodles in reserved water, adding more warm water if needed to cover; allow to soak until soft, about 10 minutes. Drain and cut noodles if desired.</p>
    <h5>Step 3</h5>
    <p>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Add achiote powder and continue to cook and stir until the mixture is well coated. Stir in shredded chicken meat, sliced shiitake mushrooms, and fish sauce; season with salt and pepper.</p>
    <h5>Step 4</h5>
    <p>Stir in chicken broth and reserved cooking liquid from chicken. Bring to a boil for 5 minutes. Add noodles and cook 5 minutes more. Garnish with green onions.</p>
